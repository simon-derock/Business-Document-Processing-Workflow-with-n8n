‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ Finished Processing PDF Files/ (ID: 1KCeFtVVLJWS_37-sPCNvUvSpxlnRAHbW)

```

### Installation Steps

1. **Import Workflow**
```

Import the pdf_agent.json file into your n8n instance

```

2. **Configure Credentials**
- Add Google Drive OAuth2 credentials
- Add Google Docs OAuth2 credentials
- Add OpenAI API credentials

3. **Update Folder IDs**
- Replace folder IDs in the workflow with your actual Google Drive folder IDs
- Update the `folderToWatch` parameter in the Google Drive trigger

4. **Activate Workflow**
- Enable the workflow in n8n
- Set trigger to monitor the input folder

## üîß Configuration

### Google Drive Trigger Settings

```

{
"triggerOn": "specificFolder",
"folderToWatch": "1geU5SC7m4AWGGh5HzMYEluOGwrdlJIHA",
"event": "fileCreated",
"pollTimes": {
"mode": "everyMinute"
}
}

```

### OpenAI Model Configuration

```

{
"model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
"options": {}
}

```

### Document Template Structure

The workflow generates Google Docs with the following sections:

- **Main Theme**: Document purpose and target audience
- **Document Summary**: Section-by-section breakdown
- **Key Takeaways**: Important insights and conclusions
- **Gaps & Limitations**: Identified weaknesses and omissions  
- **Follow-Up Questions**: Suggested areas for deeper investigation
- **Terminology Clarification**: Definitions of complex terms
- **Structural Observations**: Document organization analysis

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Upload PDF**: Drop any PDF file into the monitored Google Drive folder
2. **Automatic Processing**: Workflow triggers automatically and processes the document
3. **Analysis Generation**: AI agents analyze different aspects of the document
4. **Summary Creation**: Comprehensive Google Doc summary is generated
5. **File Organization**: Original PDF is moved to "Finished Processing" folder

### Advanced Features

- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple PDFs uploaded simultaneously via loop controls
- **Error Handling**: Includes dual-loop architecture for reliability
- **Structured Output**: All AI responses use JSON schema validation
- **File Naming**: Generated summaries maintain original filename with "PDF Summary" suffix

## üìä Output Format

### Generated Summary Structure

Each processed document produces a Google Doc containing:

```


# [Original Filename]

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Workflow Execution

Monitor workflow execution through n8n's interface:

- **Execution History**: Track successful and failed runs
- **Node Outputs**: Inspect data flow between nodes
- **Error Logs**: Identify and resolve processing issues

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Trigger not firing | Incorrect folder permissions | Verify Google Drive folder access |
| PDF extraction fails | Corrupted or password-protected PDF | Ensure PDFs are accessible and not encrypted |
| AI processing errors | API rate limits or invalid responses | Check OpenAI API quotas and response formats |
| Google Doc creation fails | Insufficient permissions | Verify Google Docs API access and folder permissions |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Store all API credentials securely in n8n's credential manager
- **Folder Permissions**: Restrict Google Drive folder access to authorized users only  
- **Data Privacy**: Consider data residency requirements for sensitive documents
- **Access Logging**: Monitor API usage and document access patterns

## üîß Customization Options

### AI Agent Modifications

Each AI agent can be customized by modifying the `systemMessage` parameter:

- **Adjust Analysis Depth**: Modify prompts for more detailed or concise analysis
- **Domain Specialization**: Tailor agents for specific document types (legal, technical, financial)
- **Output Format Changes**: Modify JSON schemas for different output structures

### Integration Extensions

- **Slack Notifications**: Add Slack webhook for processing completion alerts
- **Email Reports**: Integrate email nodes for summary distribution
- **Database Storage**: Store analysis results in databases for reporting
- **Custom Workflows**: Extend processing based on document classification

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Batch Processing Configuration

The workflow includes two loop controls:
- **Loop Over Items**: Primary batch processing loop
- **2nd Loop Over Items**: Secondary processing loop for reliability

### Resource Management

- **Concurrent Executions**: Limit simultaneous workflow runs to prevent API throttling
- **Timeout Settings**: Configure appropriate timeouts for long document processing
- **Memory Management**: Monitor n8n instance resources during large file processing
